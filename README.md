This Python application allows the user to interact with a thought-provoking question using speech recognition and computer vision. Here's how it works:

It utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize speech input from the microphone and the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech.

The listen() function is responsible for listening to the user's response. It adjusts for ambient noise, listens to the audio input, and then attempts to recognize the speech using Google's speech recognition service. It handles any errors that may occur during the speech recognition process.

The main function continuously listens for the user's response. When the user responds with "yes" or "no", the program detects the head movement corresponding to the response using computer vision.
